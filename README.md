## Test Assignment

This assignment was built with React and redux and deployed to [Heroku](http://secure-citadel-62833.herokuapp.com/) <br/>
(please wait a minute when open the link - it has to wake up :)

### Things to be improved

- I prefer to build an app with "mobile-first" approach, <br/>
  but in that case I started with desktop (as it was the only provided design)
- API is available only with http, to get higher score in lighthose and provide more security is better to change it to https
- Styles can be improved (using SASS, BEM and pixel-perfect)

### Getting Started

Step-by-step instructions to get you up and running!

#### Clone the repo

Clone the repo to your local machine: <br/>
`git@github.com:apavlushina/sbrothers.git`

#### Install required dependencies

If not already installed, install dependencies in the project directory by running the following:

- `npm install`

#### Store the authorization token

The app expects environment variable `REACT_APP_AUTH="your token"`

#### How to run locally

In the project directory execute `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
